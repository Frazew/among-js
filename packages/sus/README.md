# Sus | Among JS

Simple and expressive object-oriented library for easily making bots and clients. This is part of Among JS, a simple and flexible library for interacting with the Among Us protocol.

Currently, the only thing here is [AmongUsSocket](https://among-js-docs.vercel.app/classes/sus.amongussocket.html), a monolithic class for interacting as a fake Among Us player.
