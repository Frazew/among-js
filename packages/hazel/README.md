# Hazel | Among JS

A library for interacting with the Hazel network protocol. This is part of Among JS, a simple and flexible library for interacting with the Among Us protocol.

Currently, the only thing here is [HazelUDPSocket](https://among-js-docs.vercel.app/classes/hazel.hazeludpsocket.html), which uses UDP to transport messages. In the future things like WebSockets will be supported as well so you can run Among Us clients entirely in the browser.
