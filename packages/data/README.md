# Data | Among JS

Among Us constants, enums, types, static game data, and more. This is part of Among JS, a simple and flexible library for interacting with the Among Us protocol. You can find documentation [here](https://among-js-docs.vercel.app/modules/data.html).

The data is currently organized into 4 groups:

- Enums: constants for flags, packet types, and game data like colors
- Types: rich types for packets and mother structured data
- Static: data taken from the game such as matchmaking servers and map layouts
- Utilities: type assertions and functions to convert enums to human-readable text
